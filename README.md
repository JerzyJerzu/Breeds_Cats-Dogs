This project was done as a part of Machine Leanring and Deep Leanirng course, that I took during my Erasmus at Klagenfurt Univeristy. The project was developed on Kaggle platform, and Github was used for version control, after I realized, that it can be easily linked with Kaggle. All the links to Kggle versions of the notebooks and dataset are at the last page of the report. To run the traning on Kaggle enable GPU acceleration.
